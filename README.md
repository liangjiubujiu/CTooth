We strongly believe this work is a valuable and desired asset to share in public for computer-aided tooth image research. Our goal is to **collect and annotate a 3D tooth dataset, implement an open-source tooth volume segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch**.    
#### Top priorities 22-07
[Update] This [conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08778) has been accepted on 2022 [ICIRA](https://icira2022.org/camera-ready-submission/).

[Update] We will release our dental dataset **CTooth** and more data samples later in these two months. Please follow us and watch this Github repository for releases to be notified. 


### Datasets 
If you would like to access to the **CTooth** dataset, please send an email guided by **Data_requistion.md** to the [author](acw499@qmul.ac.uk). You will notice our updates via a Wechat group or following our Github account.

## Latest features (06/2022)

- On the fly 3D total volume visualization
- Tensorboard and PyTorch 1.4+ support to track training progress
- Code cleanup and packages creation
- Evaluation visualization


## Support 
If you **really** like this repository and find it useful, please consider (★) **starring** it, so that it can reach a broader audience of like-minded people. It would be highly appreciated :) !

## Contributing to CTooth
If you find a bug, create a GitHub issue, or even better, submit a pull request. Similarly, if you have questions, simply post them as GitHub issues. More info on the [contribute directory](./contribute/readme.md).
